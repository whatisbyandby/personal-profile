I currently work as a Solutions Architect at eXp Realty. I work with product and engineering leaders to design and implement solutions that support close to 100k real estate agents across the globe. I lead an engineering governance group, where the engineering leader discuss and define the best practices we follow, to ensure our services are robust, scalable, and secure. A notable project I was worked on was a self-service automated deployment pipeline for engineering and quality assurance teams. This project allowed the organization to go from a completely manually testing a deployment process, to a self-service portal for technical and non-technical users where each deployment can leverage automated quality gates to help push toward a goal of stable and consitent deployments.
