During my time as a Senior Software Engineer at Advanced Group, I worked to extend and maintain an in house clinical trial management system. This system was used to collect sensitive data related to clinical trials and was subject to strict regulatory requirements. A notable project I worked on was a deidentification process for the production data. This allowed for testing and development to be performed on production data, without exposing sensitive PII.
