As the Innovation Team Lead at TimeSeries US, I worked with the CTO to design and implement solution templates that could be used to quickly deploy solutions for clients. I worked with the engineering team to ensure that the solutions were robust, scalable, and secure. I also worked with the sales team to help them understand the technical aspects of the solutions we were offering. A notable project I worked on was a solution template for a smart warehouse system, that was integrated with an RFID reader to track inventory in real time. I also continued to work as a consultant as a solution architect, working with client in manufacturing and healthcare.
